# Goal reliability milestones

- 2026-09-08: Read current upstream guidance, the prior failure evidence,
  Anthropic's SDLC playbook, and applicable installed engineering skills.
- Clarification: the package implements persistent goals; SDLC is solely the
  development process for its fork. No SDLC package feature is planned.
- Prepared intent, spec, plan, glossary, ADRs, tracker, and draft tickets in
  disposable staging before the remote fork operation. Upstream base:
  fe430b251eeaff4ff7c041085fd05458b2776cb9.
- Product implementation and test-seam approval are pending. No code or new
  product tests were written as part of this planning checkpoint.

- Planning packet checks passed at 2026-09-08T16:39:24.449Z, before the GitHub fork was created at 2026-09-08T16:39:42Z. All 24 staged document hashes matched during transfer.
- Created https://github.com/justinbeausoleil/pi-goal-x as a fork of tmonk/pi-goal-x and cloned it under ~/Developer/tools/pi-goal-x. Both remote main and the local base matched the reviewed commit.
- Prepared docs/goal-reliability-plan for document review. Runtime code, existing tests, dependency manifests, workflows, and MIT license are unchanged.
- Documentation validation passed: local links, G1–G9 ticket coverage, seven
  draft tickets and their ordered blocking edges, glossary-only CONTEXT.md,
  exact CLAUDE.md import, and preserved upstream instructions. Staged diff
  whitespace passed. The 25 changed files are Markdown only; runtime paths,
  tests, manifests, workflows, and license match the reviewed base exactly.
- No runtime tests were rerun for this documentation-only change. Existing
  triage outcomes are cited as baseline evidence, not as proof of fork repairs.
